                    DPDP act mandates consent obligations on private entities while carving out broad exemptions for state surveillance. The Sanchar Saathi app’s now withdrawn mandatory pre-installation directive further sharpens this two-tier privacy regime.

                        On one hand, regulators penalise private companies for processing data without explicit consent, on the other, operate under a framework exempting the state from these very requirements. <br><h2 style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;">The Two-Tier Framework</h2>Section 6 of the <a id="20012823" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="dpdp-act" source="keywords" class="news-keywords" href="/tag/dpdp+act">DPDP Act</a> requires private organisations to obtain free, informed, and unambiguous consent before processing personal data. This requirement is absolute for private entities processing everything from purchase history to location data. Simultaneously, Section 17 of <a href="/tag/dpdp+act">DPDP Act</a> and the schedules of the DPDP Rules carve out broad exemptions for the government, permitting the state to process personal data for ‘sovereignty, integrity, public order, and national security’ without adequate data privacy safeguards .<br><br><!-- PROMOSLOT_M -->“The pre-installation mandate has reportedly been withdrawn, and manufacturers are no longer required to pre-install the app on devices. Users now engage with the app only if they choose to download it, which resolves the consent issue at the installation stage,” said Supratim Chakraborty, partner at Khaitan &amp; Co.. “For personal data collected during use of the app, Section 17(1)(c) of the DPDP Act provides the State with an express exemption from core obligations, including notice and consent, when processing personal data for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences, subject to the safeguards set out in the DPDP Act, an exemption unavailable to private organisations. Sanchar Saathi’s telecom-fraud-prevention objectives likely fall within this statutory exemption,”<br><br><!-- PROMOSLOT_M -->

                        “The government needs to visibly demonstrate that it practices the same standard to which it holds a private organisation,” said Anindya Majumdar, a leading privacy counsel. “Since privacy is a fundamental right, the government needs to ensure that it will uphold the letter of the law and will not claim exception under law simply because it is the government.”<br><br><!-- PROMOSLOT_M -->“The DPDPA does not establish consent as the only lawful basis for processing personal data,” said Akshayy S Nanda, partner at Saraf and Partners. “Instead, Section 4 provides two independent pathways for lawful processing – ‘consent’ or ‘legitimate uses’. This structure—consent or legitimate uses—reflects a foundational principle of modern privacy law: that processing can be justified on multiple grounds, not merely individual authorisation.”<br><br><!-- PROMOSLOT_M --><!-- PROMOSLOT -->The implications expand further when examining Rule 23 of the DPDP Rules, which grants the government authority to demand personal data from organisations without prior judicial authorisation or proportionality assessment. This provision can turn every organisation into a potential data intermediary for state purposes, yet provides no clear boundaries on constitutes a legitimate request.<br><br>“Rule 23 empowers the Central Government to demand personal data for purposes listed in the Seventh Schedule, such as national security, public order, or law enforcement, and allows the government to restrict disclosure to affected individuals,” Ankita Jha, Director Legal at a leading AI tech company “While the law does not mandate prior judicial approval, organisations can responsibly handle such requests by implementing formal internal protocols, detailed documentation, and strong technical and organisational security measures."<br><br><!-- PROMOSLOT -->“The Rule does not grant unlimited access authority. It confines government information requests to such purposes, as are specified in the Seventh Schedule. The first restructuring requirement is implementing a data classification framework that enables rapid identification and extraction of personal data responsive to government requests,” noted Nanda. <br><br>While private organisations face audits, breach notifications, and potential financial penalties, the government’s data collection remains opaque. No sunset clauses limit how long the state retains data. No proportionality testing constrains access. No independent oversight mechanism exists to assess whether a government data request truly serves a legitimate national interest or merely exercises discretionary state power.<br><h2 style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;">The ‘Scope’ Question</h2>The Sanchar Saathi app was authorised to verify <a id="20052743" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="imei" source="keywords" class="news-keywords" href="/tag/imei">IMEI</a> numbers and prevent phone theft. Its declared purposes are narrow and operationally clear. Yet its permission structure grants access to call logs, SMS, device network state, and storage.<br><br>"The concern surrounding the mandatory installation of the app stems from two sources, firstly the attempt to compel actions by entities which merely use phone numbers, and secondly the potential for the features of the application to be expanded in the future," said Arun Prabhu, partner and co- head, digital +, TMT at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas. "If the application is indeed optional, and could be unstinatalled at any point, it may have been less intrusive and more proportional to merely encourage its use, rather than mandate it."<br><br>The absence of a remedial framework presents a deeper vulnerability. If the government collects data for fraud prevention today, what prevents its use for surveillance tomorrow? If the DPDP Act exempts state processing for ‘national security,’ how narrowly can courts construe this exemption? <br><br>Jha argues that the app’s stated purposes can be “tied back to the app’s core objectives of <a href="/tag/imei">IMEI</a> verification and theft/fraud prevention,” but notes that “whether scope expansion or overreach occurs after collection is ultimately a factual determination.”<br><br>Hemant Kumar Shukla, VP Legal at Yotta Data Services said, “If the app directly by default processes personal data then it’s a straightway intrusion in individuals’ privacy. The DoT and the app manufacturer should inherently develop a consent mechanism within the app to function seeking explicit consent of data subjects before processing personal data.”<br><br>“Is Sanchar Saathi limiting its collection to these functional necessities, or is it collecting data categories that go beyond what is required?” asked Nanda.<br><br>“If the app is indeed restricting its data access to phone number, IMEI, and call/SMS logs, then the principle of data minimisation enshrined in the DPDPA is respected. However, if the app is accessing location data, browsing history, application usage patterns, contact lists, photos, or other data categories not directly related to <a href="/tag/imei+verification">IMEI verification</a> or fraud reporting, then data minimisation is violated regardless of the app's stated purposes,” he answered. <br><br>“In practicality it is difficult to expect the government not to enhance its scope of data collection at times when it believes there is a justifiable need to do so and is also protected under the same ambit of law,” opined Majumdar. “An organisation can always appeal to the regulator or the courts if it feels that it is being subject to scrutiny that increases the risk of it being found in violation of its legal obligations due to enhanced governmental data collection.” <br><br>The auto-registration mechanism through which the Sanchar Saathi app detects phone numbers and sends automatic SMS without explicit user confirmation, exemplifies the consent paradox. <br><br>Shukla noted that this mechanism violates the DPDP Act's requirement for explicit consent. Ankita Jha concurred, recommending that the app be redesigned to require “a clear, unambiguous affirmative action, such as an ‘Accept and Register’ button.”<br><br>“Based on a review of the publicly available privacy policy, the premise of automatic registration does not appear to be there,” said Chakraborty. “The policy indicates that permissions are sought at each stage for the collection and use of personal data required for registration-related features.” <br><br>“In spite of Section 17 exemption, the app’s design indicates that permissions are actively sought, which suggests that possibly the current implementation is not operating on an automatic registration model. If, in practice, a future implementation were to bypass user permissions, concerns would need to be addressed at that stage,” he added.<br><h2 style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:18pt;margin-bottom:6pt;">A Clouded Affair</h2>“Apple’s potential resistance to the Sanchar Saathi pre-installation mandate underscores a critical precedent: companies may face a choice between complying with local regulations and maintaining global corporate privacy commitments,” said Jha. “If regulatory penalties are imposed, it would test the limits of national enforcement against the operational and reputational priorities of multinational corporations”<br><br>“Law must unify the rules extending coverage under its rules to all (whether Government or Pvt Data Processors),” said Shukla. “It is only through time and judicial intervention that the law will develop towards eventually reconciling all the obligations,” concluded Majumdar. <br><br>The Sanchar Saathi episode may be remembered less for a now-withdrawn mandate than as the moment when India’s surveillance-capable digital state and its fundamental right to privacy were finally forced into the same courtroom.<br><br>The coming months and years will determine whether India develops a coherent, unified data protection regime or persists with a bifurcated system that protects private sector compliance while exempting the state from the same obligations it imposes on others.
